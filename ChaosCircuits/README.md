# Chaos Machine Project

One of my ideas/projects is constructing a Chaotic (Chua) Circuit and hooking it 
up to a display so you can observe the chaotic behavior.

The idea is for a sculptural thing that shows chaos. A Chaos Machine

I've gotten as far as simulating the circuit in Spice. 
The top level directory has spice circuit models and captured waveforms.

"docs" has papers I collected in my research. I did NOT write these. They are simply references that will be 
useful for when I get back to working on this thing.
